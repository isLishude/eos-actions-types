// The community agrees to allow {{producer}} to authenticate peers as necessary to prevent abuse and denial of service attacks;
// however, {{producer}} agrees not to discriminate against non-abusive peers.
// I agree to process transactions on a FIFO best-effort basis and to honestly bill transactions for measured execution time.
// I {{producer}} agree not to manipulate the contents of blocks in order to derive profit from:
//   - the order in which transactions are included
//   - the hash of the block that is produced
// I, {{producer}}, hereby agree to disclose and attest under penalty of perjury all ultimate beneficial owners of my company who own more than 10% and all direct shareholders.
// I, {{producer}}, hereby agree to cooperate with other block producers to carry out our respective and mutual obligations under this agreement, including but not limited to maintaining network stability and a valid blockchain.
